## Success of this project will mean:
1. A working and verified Master Edition to represent the entire collection. 
(Example https://explorer.solana.com/address/6mszaj17KSfVqADrQj3o4W3zoLMTykgmV37W4QadCczK)

2. A working and verified Master Edition with a max supply of 5 that is tied back to #1 via collection metadata. 
Example (https://explorer.solana.com/address/A5mMGRbTPN727r3u4XAH6AsAT3nFjuBXyi5nVFeF35ZK/metadata) - Note, this example only has a max supply of 1, but it does show how it is verified and tied back to the nft in point 1.

3. A working and verifiable mint function that will mint an edition copy of the NFT in #2 to any wallet.
4. All source code must be provided to achieve these functions.
